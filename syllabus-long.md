## Course Description 

This course has been designed to show the interplay between the theory of algorithms (specification, verification, time/space complexity) and hands-on applications to software engineering.

From the [course catalog](https://catalog.chapman.edu/): Prerequisite, MATH 250 and CPSC 350. Students study ideas and techniques useful for designing and analyzing data structures and algorithms. In particular, the analytic tools needed for analyzing upper bounds for algorithms and lower bounds for problems will be covered. Problem areas include sorting, graph-based problems, dynamic programming, combinatorial algorithms, computational geometry, encryption, parallel and distributed models, and NP-completeness. 3 credits, letter grade with Pass/No Pass option.

## Course Learning Outcomes

See also the [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

After completing this course, students will be able to classify different kind of algorithms and understand how they can be applied to solve real-world problems, from design and implementation to analysis of their time and space complexity.

Finally, students will appreciate that mathematics is not only important for developers who create the tools used in everyday engineering practice, but also that the knowledge of the mathematical concepts and results underpinning these engineering tools impacts everyday engineering practice (and increases your chances to pass a coding interview). I discuss some aspects of this in a these notes on [mathematics as a programming language](https://hackmd.io/s/ByGLTvFDE).

## Required Text

The technical content of the course will be distributed via a git repository. 

## Course Materials 

All course materials will be made available via a git repository.

## Assessment

Assessment will be divided into a total of 200 points.

- A [project](projects.md) worth 90 points.

- [Participation](participation.md) worth 20 points.

- A [report](report.md) worth 90 points.

## Course Grade Breakdown

Grading scale used for the course:

| Percentage | Letter |
|---|---|
| 90 |	A |
| 80-89 | 	B |
| 70-79	| C |
| 60-69	| D |
| < 60 |	F |

You must score a 70 or above to receive a P when taking the course P/NP.

## Late Policy

It is important to start working on any assignment before the deadline. For example, in case you have questions, there needs to be time to aske them in office hours. On the other hand, I want you to do good work and I am happy to give you more time if that improves the quality of your work. Here are the rules I came up with:

- If midnight approaches and you need a bit more time to finish that is not a problem as long as you submit before the sun rises.

- If you need more time than that you need to be able to convince me that you started early and already have done substantial work (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository). You need to send me an email explaining the special circumstances at least one day before the deadline.

I reserve the right to not grade any work that does not follow this policy.

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture. 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.

## Policies required to be listed via University guidelines

#### Chapman University’s Academic Integrity Policy

Chapman University is a community of scholars that emphasizes the mutual responsibility of all members to seek knowledge honestly and in good faith.  Students are responsible for doing their own work and academic dishonesty of any kind will be subject to sanction by the instructor/administrator and referral to the university Academic Integrity Committee, which may impose additional sanctions including expulsion.  Please see the full description of Chapman University's policy on Academic Integrity.

#### Chapman University’s Students with Disabilities Policy

In compliance with ADA guidelines, students who have any condition, either permanent or temporary, that might affect their ability to perform in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services.  If you will need to utilize your approved accommodations in this class, please follow the proper notification procedure for informing your professor(s).  This notification process must occur more than a week before any accommodation can be utilized.  Please contact Disability Services at (714) 516–4520 if you have questions regarding this procedure or for information or to make an appointment to discuss and/or request potential accommodations based on documentation of your disability.  Once formal approval of your need for an accommodation has been granted, you are encouraged to talk with your professor(s) about your accommodation options.  The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.

#### Chapman University’s Equity and Diversity Policy

Chapman University is committed to ensuring equality and valuing diversity.  Students and professors are reminded to show respect at all times as outlined in Chapman’s Harassment and Discrimination Policy.  Please review the full description of Harassment and Discrimination Policy. Any violations of this policy should be discussed with the professor, the Dean of Students and/or otherwise reported in accordance with this policy.”

#### Student Support at Chapman University

Over the course of the semester, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with your learning, such as problems with friend, family, and or significant other relationships; substance use; concerns about personal adequacy; feeling overwhelmed; or feeling sad or anxious without knowing why.  These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.  You can learn more about the resources available through Chapman University’s Student Psychological Counseling Services.

Fostering a community of care that supports the success of students is essential to the values of Chapman University.  Occasionally, you may come across a student whose personal behavior concerns or worries you, either for the student’s well-being or yours.  In these instances, you are encouraged to contact the Chapman University Student Concern Intervention Team who can respond to these concerns and offer assistance. While it is preferred that you include your contact information so this team can follow up with you, you can submit a report anonymously.  24-hour emergency help is also available through Public Safety at 714-997-6763.

#### Religious Accommodation

Religious Accommodation at Chapman University Consistent with our commitment of creating an academic community that is respectful of and welcoming to persons of differing backgrounds, we believe that every reasonable effort should be made to allow members of the university community to fulfill their obligations to the university without jeopardizing the fulfillment of their sincerely held religious obligations. Please review the syllabus early in the semester and consult with your faculty member promptly regarding any possible conflicts with major religious holidays, being as specific as possible regarding when those holidays are scheduled in advance and where those holidays constitute the fulfillment of your sincerely held religious beliefs.

#### Changes
This syllabus is subject to change. Updates will be posted on the course website.
